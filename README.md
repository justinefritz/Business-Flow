# business-flow
This is my ICT 103: FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING MIDTERM PROJECT during my 1st Year of studying BS in Computer Science in Iloilo Science and Technology University S.Y 2022-2023.

I decided to make a business flow program that describes the simple workplace flow of the University of the Registrar and Admission of Iloilo Science and Technology University.

I provided the algorithm, pseudocode, and flowcharts based on my creativity of making this program.

INSTRUCTION: When running this program, please include the code.c file to a folder with 3 other folders inside that named "ADMISSION DATA", "GRADE SHEET", and "STUDENT DATA".
